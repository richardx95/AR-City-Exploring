Intro
---

With this application you're able to explore a city in a new and innovative way.
This project is made within Untiy with ARCore and Mapbox.
You're able to change or add Points of Interest and change or create your custom content.
Not everything is fully functional, since this project is the result of a case study about AR. Feel free to improve the code or to build your own application on top of our project. :)

What Is ARCore?
---

ARCore is a Augmented Reality platform by Google which runs on selected Android devices. ARCore apps can be build in Android Studio, Unity and even on the web with WebXR. ARCore is the layer which enables your app to have AR components. In this project, we used Google's ARCore package for Unity which can be found here: https://github.com/google-ar/arcore-unity-sdk/releases

You can check if your phone supports ARCore by visiting Google's developer site: https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/supported-devices

---
What Is Mapbox?
---

Mapbox is a online map provider, which works like Google Maps. The difference is that Mapbox has a ton of cool API's and features and has way more data for a developer to use. It also is compatible with a lot of platforms and SDKs, such as Unity.

---
How To Use Mapbox?
---

To use the Mapbox-powered example in this Unity project you'll need a Mapbox account to use a Access Token (which is free to start with). You can create a Mapbox account on their website, http://mapbox.com. 

---

Installation
---

Download or clone the full repository and open it in Unity. After that, go to "Mapbox" in the menu bar at the top. Then, select "Setup" and insert your access token.

How To Customise The Points Of Interest?
---

First, open the Unity Project and the WorldAR scene. Then select the ArAlignedMap object in the scene, which is under WorldAlignmentKit. Under the Abstract Map script, you'll see a section called "Map Layers". Under that, there is a subsection called "Points of Interest"
